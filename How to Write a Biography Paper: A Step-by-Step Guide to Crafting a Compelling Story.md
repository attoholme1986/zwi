## What is a Biography Paper?

A biography paper is a written account of someone’s life. Unlike an autobiography, which is written by the individual themselves, a biography is an in-depth exploration of another person’s life. This may include their early years, achievements, significant life events, and the impact they had on society. A biography paper can be either a short essay or a longer research paper, depending on your assignment's requirements.
